# MNIST-Digit-Recognizer-and-Classifier

The MNIST dataset is a well-known and widely used dataset in the machine learning community, particularly for tasks involving image classification. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, which are 28 pixels by 28 pixels in size and represent a single digit from 0 through 9. The images are divided into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. The dataset was created by NIST and has been widely used in research and academic settings for testing and evaluating machine learning models.
